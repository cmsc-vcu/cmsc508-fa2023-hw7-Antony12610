The document is structured to present a database project's details and functionality using a combination of markdown text and Python code cells. It covers an overview of the project's aim, an explanation of an ER diagram, descriptions of database tables ('People,' 'Skills,' and 'Roles'), snapshots of table data, sample SQL queries, and their respective outputs. Overall, it efficiently combines explanations, code snippets, and query results to demonstrate the database's design, contents, and querying capabilities.

## Overview and description

This project centers on constructing a comprehensive database to consolidate the skills, certifications, and roles of company employees. It aims to streamline skill-based employee searches, track skill acquisition and anticipated dates, and facilitate role assignments. The database encompasses tables for skills/certifications, employees, and roles, fostering associations between skills and employees as well as employees and roles. It serves to identify skill sets, evaluate employee skills, and analyze skill gaps within specific roles, fostering efficient talent management and skill optimization within the company.

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from skills;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```
### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from roles;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

# List skill names, tags, and descriptions ordered by name

(here a sample query)

```{python}
sql = f"""
select * from people
"""
```


(and here is a sample result from the query)

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```


### List people names and email addresses ordered by last_name

```{python}
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM people
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### List skill names of Person 1


### List people names with Skill 6


### List people with a DEVELOPER role


### List names and email addresses of people without skills


### List names and tags of unused skills


### List people names and skill names with the BOSS role


### List ids and names of unused roles


## Reflection

(Write a paragraph expressing your thoughts, feelings, and insights about your experience with this assignment.  Pause and breath before writing - I'm trying to encourage critical thinking and self-awareness while allowing you to explore the connections between theory and practice. And yes, delete this paragraph.)
